# STliFT
This code is a Matlab function of Semidefinite relaxation-based algorithm (STliFT) to generate restored signal given a STFT magnitude measurements. 

Requirements:  
(1) MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox, or you can use "for" instead of "parfor" in the function.   
(2) CVX: You can download in http://cvxr.com/cvx/.

The code is based on the theory described in:
